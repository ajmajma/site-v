					<p>Everyone seems to be talking about big data – it’s like that hit pop song that plays on your car radio, office radio, and then your television at home. It’s hard to get away from and a lot of people are saying it’s a fad.</p>

					<p>On the contrary though, big data is an important component of business, big and small, and is expected to take on an even larger role in future. <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918">Gartner</a> predicts big data will reach mainstream adoption in 5 to 10 years.</p>

					<h3>Real-World Applications</h3>

					<p>If you're still unsure what this "buzzword" means, here's the gist of it: big data describes high-volume structured and unstructured data that is so large and moves so fast it requires advanced processing. Big data provides enhanced insights, helping companies operate more efficiently and make faster, smarter decisions.</p>

					<blockquote>“There is a big data revolution,” says Weatherhead University Professor <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2014/03/why-big-data-is-a-big-deal#article-images">Gary King</a>. But it is not the quantity of data that is revolutionary. “The big data revolution is that now we can  do  something with the data.”</blockquote>

					<p>Though it’s expected to take at least another 5 years before enterprises fully embrace big data initiatives, big data is already making an impact today and streaming from everywhere – systems, social media, mobile devices, and sensors. </p>

					<p>Online retailers use big data to make recommendations while you shop, helpfully pointing out that "Others who purchased this item also bought...," or offering special discounts based on data from your past purchases.</p>

					<p>Big data is used to analyze supply chain logistics. By combining GPS and traffic information, decisions can be made on the fly about the best route for a delivery driver to take, saving on fuel and ensuring goods make it the client on time.</p>

					<p>Have an energy leak in your facility? Big data will let you know. MIT is currently utilizing sensors and analytic software to make buildings across its campus more efficient, saving money and reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

					<p>If you've seen <i>Moneyball</i> you may not have realized that big data was at play there too. The film is based on the true story of how the Oakland Athletics' management used in-depth analytical evidence of player performance to assemble a competitive team, despite a limited budget.</p>   

					<h4>Positioning Your Business for the Big Data Revolution</h4>

					<p>One of the challenges companies face in regards to big data is finding a convenient way to process and access it. Big data can best be utilized through a cloud-based platform that allows information to be connected as a single network of collaborative, mobile-friendly business functions.</p>

					<p>Volute, a revolutionary Enterprise Widget Platform and Marketplace, eases the way organizations interact with their data through a new concept called wPaaS. <a href="http://volute.co/blog2.html">wPaaS (Widget Platform as a Service)</a> is a movement towards the standardization of business functions or services and offers consistency while still allowing for full customization.</p>

					<p>Volute uses Widgets, a new web app technology that implements business requirements as 3D, interactive cubes that can be turned and flipped, shared, and integrated with each other or any system or service. These Widgets are published to a company’s private Volute Marketplace, organized, and made accessible from any computer or mobile device.</p>

					<p>By handling data in this way, users are able to interact with a wide variety of data from anywhere in the world and create custom views that allow them to focus on what matters most, preventing data overload from information irrelevant to their roles. </p>

					<p>Data from any system can be integrated with Volute’s smart Widgets, eliminating the need to access multiple disparate systems. Since Widgets connect to each other and third-party systems and services, new data can be derived by combing information from systems that traditionally operate as silos.</p>

					<p>For example, here are some ways you could customize Volute and react to events faster than ever before:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Connect Widget to sensors, social media, email, and other big data technologies and devices to monitor cyber security, preventing fraud and data breaches before they happen</li>

					<li>Sync you scheduling processes to data from the National Weather Service, improving operational planning for your seasonal business or optimizing the time of your team working  outside in the field </li>

					<li>Get 360 degree views of your customers by collecting data about their web searches, purchases, rewards points, and what they are saying about your company to identify their needs and improve the consumer experience </li>
					</ul>

					<p>Is your business using big data to the fullest?</p>
