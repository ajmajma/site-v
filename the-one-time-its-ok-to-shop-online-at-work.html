					<p>More options and fast convenient access to what you want...</p>
					<p>These are the elements that draw us to online shopping and the reasons why this practice is making its way into the workplace in the form of enterprise app stores. </p>
					<p>By 2017 <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2334015">Gartner</a> predicts 1 in 4 enterprises will have an enterprise app store, but what you may not realize is they lack critical features. We'll tell you what they are, and how to implement them in your own marketplace of enterprise applications.</p>

					<h3>Benefits (and Risks) of an Enterprise App Store</h3>

					<p>Forward-thinking businesses recognize the potential of taking the app store, a consumer technology, and leveraging it to control what applications are used within their organization. Companies embrace this consumerization of IT to:</p>

					<h4>1. Double down on security</h4>

					<p>Data security is often the number one concern for businesses, and rightly so. According to a recent <a href="http://mobileenterprise.edgl.com/news/Millennials-are-Building-and-Bringing-Apps94128"> Mobile Enterprise article</a>, 70% of Millennials use personal devices and apps for work-related tasks, even when it’s against corporate policy.</p>

					<p>Enterprise app stores provide employees with a user-friendly alternative and make it simple to find enterprise-approved applications. Knowing the correct applications have already been vetted leaves out question as to what app and version to download.</p>

					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Even with the right applications, your data can still be at risk. Native apps often store data on the device they are installed on, putting your business information in jeopardy on tablets and smartphones that are easily lost or stolen.</p>
						
					<h4>2. Meet employee expectations</h4>

					<p>Employees are happier and more productive at work using the same devices and technologies they use at home - especially Millennials, who are expected to account for half of the global workforce by 2020, <a href="http://www.pwc.com/en_M1/m1/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf"> according to PwC</a>. Already familiar with Apple’s App Store and Google Play, using an enterprise app store to download the tools they need for work is an easy policy to adhere to.</p>
					
					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Most apps are not device agnostic, meaning they do not work across operating systems or on different types of devices. To reach all users, multiple, costly native mobile apps must be developed.</p>

					<h4>3. Increase productivity</h4>

					<p>The best apps keep employees engaged and increase productivity and efficiency, giving users reasons to be excited about using enterprise provided applications vs. looking elsewhere. Development teams are encouraged to continually strive to develop new, better apps to keep users coming back.</p>

					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Even with the most talented developers, apps can only increase productivity so much. Since apps do not integrate well with each other or your systems, employees must still access several systems throughout the day.</p>

					<h3>Solutions to Common App Store Problems</h3>

					<p>Companies can overcome the issues faced by enterprise app stores with a secure web and mobile solution that ingrates with any business system or service.</p>

					<h4>1. Keeps your information secure</h4>

					<p>Use a store for web-based applications that keeps your corporate data safely in your own system. A secure solution will retrieve your data from your system long enough for you to work with it, but will not store it on your device where it is easily breached.</p>

					<h4>2. Reach every user</h4>

					<p>Create a cloud-based marketplace of applications that are accessible from every desktop and mobile device, regardless of operating system. Applications built with RWD (responsive web design) will adapt to fit any screen size, reaching anyone using any desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone.</p>

					<h4>3. Access a network of collaborating functions</h4>

					<p>Interact with your data and functions through Widgets, a new web app technology. Widgets are better suited than traditional apps to integrate with each other and your third-party systems and services. They foster the creation of a single intelligent network of collaborating functions you can access from a single platform – saving you time and increasing efficiency. Read this article on wPaaS (Widget Platform as a Service) for more information about <a href="http://www.volute.co/the-software-revolution-you're-missing-out-on.html">Widgets and their benefits</a>.</p>

					<p><strong>Acquiring a solution like the one described above is easier than you think. All these features are built into Volute, a customizable enterprise Widget Marketplace and Platform that takes the app store to the next level. What to know more?
