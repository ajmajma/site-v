					<p>Online shopping certainly has appeal. From a single screen you see a world of options for adding to your wardrobe, home décor, or whatever else it is you seek. With a few quick clicks an item is soon on its way to your front door. What would have taken an hour trip to the store was finished in minutes from your couch.</p>
					<p>This idea of having more options and fast, convenient access to what you want is being adopted in the workplace. The items being “purchased” are enterprise applications. By 2017 <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2334015">Gartner</a> predicts 1 in 4 enterprises will have an enterprise app store, but there is an even better option.</p>

					<h3>Benefits (and Risks) of an Enterprise App Store</h3>

					<p>Forward-thinking businesses recognize the potential of taking a consumer technology, the app store, and leveraging it to control what applications are used within their organization. However, enterprise app stores are not without their challenges.</p>

					<p>Companies embrace the consumerization of IT via enterprise app stores to:</p>

					<h4>1. Meet employee expectations</h4>

					<p>Employees are happier and more productive at work using the same devices and technologies they use at home - especially Millennials, who are expected to account for half of the global workforce by 2020, <a href="http://www.pwc.com/en_M1/m1/services/consulting/documents/millennials-at-work.pdf"> according to PwC</a>. Already familiar with Apple’s App Store and Google Play, using an Enterprise App Store to download the tools they need for work is an easy policy to adhere to.</p>
					
					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Most apps are not device agnostic, meaning they do not work across operating systems or on different types of devices. To reach all users, multiple, costly native mobile apps must be developed.</p>

					<h4>2. Double down on Security</h4>

					<p>Data security is often the number one concern for businesses, and rightly so. According to a recent <a href="http://mobileenterprise.edgl.com/news/Millennials-are-Building-and-Bringing-Apps94128"> Mobile Enterprise article</a>, 70% of Millennials use personal devices and apps for work-related tasks, even when it’s against corporate policy.</p>

					<p>Enterprise app stores provide employees with a user-friendly alternative and make it simple to find enterprise-approved applications. Knowing the correct applications have already been vetted and approved leaves out question as to what app and version to download.</p>

					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Even with the right applications, your data can still be at risk. Native apps often store data on the device they are installed on, putting your business your information at risk on tablets and smartphones that are easily lost or stolen.</p>

					<h4>3. Increase Productivity</h4>

					<p>The best apps keep employees engaged and increase productivity and efficiency, giving users reasons to be excited about using enterprise provided applications vs. looking elsewhere. Development teams are encouraged to continually strive to develop new, better apps to keep users coming back.</p>

					<h5>Problem:</h5>

					<p>Even with the most talented developers, apps can only increase productivity so much. Since apps do not integrate well with each other or your systems, employees must still access several systems throughout the day.</p>

					<h3>A Revolutionary Solution to Common App Store Problems</h3>

					<p>Volute takes the app store concept to a new level with the Widget Marketplace Platform. Using Widgets instead of apps, Volute overcomes issues faced by enterprises using app stores.</p>

					<h4>1. Reaches every user</h4>

					<p>Business functions for an organization’s Marketplace are custom built to their exact needs as collaborative, multi-sided Widgets that work for every desktop and mobile device, everywhere. Widgets automatically rearrange to fit any screen size, regardless of operating system.</p>

					<h4>2. Keeps Your Information Secure</h4>

					<p>Volute is web-based and your corporate data is never stored on a user’s device. Your data remains secure in your own system. Volute only retrieves this data from your system temporarily, long enough for you to work with it.</p>

					<h4>3. Facilitates Connectivity Between Systems</h4>

					<p>Widgets are better suited than apps to integrate with each other and your third-party systems and services, fostering the creation of a single intelligent network of collaborating functions. You interact with all your functions from the same platform, saving time and increasing efficiency.</p>
